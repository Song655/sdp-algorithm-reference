Real data from the VLA telescope
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file at166B.3C129.c0.vis contains data from a VLA observations of 3C129. The data are in columns of:


U(lambda)	V(lambda)	W(lambda)	Vis_Real(Jy)	Vis_Imag(Jy)	Sigma(Jy)


(U, V, W) are the uvw co-ordinates.

(Vis_Real, Vis_Imag) are the complex visibility data.

Sigma is the noise on the complex visibility data.


A (dirty) image of 3C129 can be seen in AT166B-image.png. This has been made using inverse variance weighting. The PSF image can be seen in AT166B-psf.png.
